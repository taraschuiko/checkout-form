# Pertfectial - TEST TASK


Notes (remarks and advices):
1. You skipped images than we provide in design and use Font Awesome instead.
2. Tabs in small screens doesn't represent which is active now.
3. Also layout has 10 column grid, not 12.

HTML:
Take a look for comments in index.html

JS:
Main practice is to use ID selector, just in specific case should use class or attributes selectors, but never tag selector

----
CSS:
Take a look for comments in style.scss
